<a name="change-log" class="anchor" href="#change-log"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Change Log:</h2>

<h3>
<a name="release-10" class="anchor" href="#release-10"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Release 1.0:</h3>

<p>A spiking neural network can be created which consists of basic
  integrate-and-fire neurons. These neurons show both absolute and relative
  refractory periods as well as basic spike-rate adaptation.</p>

<p>Both alternating current and Poisson noise generators are provided for
  testing neuronal dynamics.</p>

<p>Sample usage driver programs are given which create some trivial networks and
  graph the neuron potential and spike events generated.</p>

<p>A test file is provided which ensures proper behavior as features are added.</p>

<h4>
<a name="todo" class="anchor" href="#todo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TODO:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The logging system is very inefficient and needs to be replaced. This
will happen in a future release which integrates with a database for
central logging of node events.</li>
<li>The graphing functionality is barebones and produces sub-optimal
visualizations of events. The EEG graph specifically is difficult to
interpret and requires some clean-up to be maximally effective.</li>
<li>Producing a series of jpeg frames which can then be converted into
a video would serve as a very good visualization, but this is
a low-priority feature as this time.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="upcoming-changes" class="anchor" href="#upcoming-changes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upcoming changes:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Modification of the node types to incorporate message passing via sockets.
This will allow nodes to be distributed across machines as well as across
processes on the same machine. This is the focus of the next major release.</li>
<li>Integration of a database logging system for node information (membrane
potential, spike events, etc.). This will allow centralized analysis of
nodes across machines and processes.</li>
<li>Addition of a lightweight web-based interface for instantiating and
monitoring nodes across the network.</li>
</ul>
