These neurons show both absolute and relative\r\n  refractory periods as well as basic spike-rate adaptation.\r\n\r\n  Both alternating current and Poisson noise generators are provided for\r\n  testing neuronal dynamics.\r\n\r\n  Sample usage driver programs are given which create some trivial networks and\r\n  graph the neuron potential and spike events generated.\r\n\r\n  A test file is provided which ensures proper behavior as features are added.\r\n\r\n#### TODO:\r\n\r\n  * The logging system is very inefficient and needs to be replaced. This\r\n    will happen in a future release which integrates with a database for\r\n    central logging of node events.\r\n  * The graphing functionality is barebones and produces sub-optimal\r\n    visualizations of events. The EEG graph specifically is difficult to\r\n    interpret and requires some clean-up to be maximally effective.\r\n  * Producing a series of jpeg frames which can then be converted into\r\n    a video would serve as a very good visualization, but this is\r\n    a low-priority feature as this time.\r\n\r\n## Upcoming changes:\r\n  * Modification of the node types to incorporate message passing via sockets.\r\n    This will allow nodes to be distributed across machines as well as across\r\n    processes on the same machine. This is the focus of the next major release.\r\n  * Integration of a database logging system for node information (membrane\r\n    potential, spike events, etc.). This will allow centralized analysis of\r\n    nodes across machines and processes.\r\n  * Addition of a lightweight web-based interface for instantiating and\r\n    monitoring nodes across the network.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
